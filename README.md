# My Coding Study Guide (Time Capsule)

## Description

- I created this simple coding guide as a way to become familiar with entry level coding, and as something I can look back on in the future to remind me how far I've come and that there will always be room for improvement.
- Building this guide gave me the ability to learn and understand the world of coding through a "hands on" approach.
- This project has also allowed me a space to look back on simple keywords that could help me get through a mental block by rembering the steps I took to create the study guide.
- Throughout the project, I learned how critical details are in coding as one small mistake can bottleneck the whole project; while also learning the importance of retracing my steps to find what I'm missing.

## Usage

- My project includes topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. You can even open the DevTools to see the JavaScript running; where it will list a topic you can study first.
